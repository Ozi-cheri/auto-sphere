These goals work collectively to establish AutoSphere as a go-to platform for automotive news, insights, and community engagement.

## GitHub Project Board

The **GitHub Project Board** is an essential tool i used for organizing and managing the development workflow of the AutoSphere project. It helped me in such a way that i have to track progress, and ensure all project objectives are met efficiently.

### Structure of the Project Board
The project board is divided into the following columns to represent the workflow:

1. **To Do**:  
   This column contains all tasks and features that need to be implemented. It includes user stories, bug fixes, and enhancements that are planned but not yet started.

2. **In Progress**:  
   Tasks that are actively being worked on are moved to this column. This provides a clear view of what is currently being developed.


3. **Done**:  
   Once a task is reviewed, tested, and deployed, it is moved to this column to indicate completion.

### Key Features of the GitHub Project Board

- **Task Categorization**:  
  Each task is represented as a card, which includes a title, description, labels, and assignees. Labels such as `bug`, `feature`, `enhancement`, and `documentation` help categorize the cards for clarity.

- **Milestones**:  
  Milestones are used to group related tasks and track progress toward significant project goals. Each milestone represents a feature release or a development phase.
